# Welcome to the Albert SDK

Albert is a portable, multifunctional, interactive device powered by the Android operating system. It combines the openness of an app-based platform with the same stringent security standards as current card payment (EFTPOS) terminals. Featuring a 7" touchscreen, Albert enables businesses to install and use Android business and productivity applications, scan cards and accept payments, all within the same device.

Albert exists within the Pi EcoSystem, a set of Services to support the Device that includes the ability to process payments, an App Store, services to allow the Merchant to manage their devices and applications and a Developer Portal that will allow Developers to publish and manage their Applications.
